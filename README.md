## Team 750R

750R is a part of the South Brunswick High School robotics program. For their first year as a team, they exceeded all expectations and qualified for the 2019 VEX Robotics World Championships! They believe that the key to success is to remain organized and level-headed through adversity. They plan to achieve this by clearly communicating with all the team members and by balancing the workload between everyone. This year they hope to continue their success into the new season.
